Hello! Thanks for checking my profile. I am a CS student that plans to dive into Computer Vision and AI!

## Currently Working On
### DragonTaleCLI
**AI Based Story Teller**
Dragontale is an offline, AI-powered interactive storytelling engine inspired by AI Dungeon. Powered by local large language models (LLMs), Dragontale lets you embark on dynamic, open-ended adventures without relying on any external APIs or cloud services. The CLI version will later be expanded to a web version after the core AI features have been thoroughly tested.
*CLI to be finished August 2025*

### StageX
**User-Based Mobile App**
StageX is a mobile app I am currently drafting. It is a user-based application so I am thoroughly studying human psychological papers to find a good pipeline (hence stages).
*Production Starting Q1 2026*
